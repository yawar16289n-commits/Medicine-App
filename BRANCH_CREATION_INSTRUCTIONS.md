# Branch Creation Instructions

## Task Completed

A new branch named `initial` has been created locally from commit `e995597` which contains:
- Message: "corrected confilicts from last commit & solved user profile updation issues"

## Branch Status

- **Branch name**: `initial`
- **Base commit**: `e995597`
- **Status**: Created locally

## Manual Steps Required

Due to authentication constraints in the automated environment, the `initial` branch has been created locally but needs to be pushed to the remote repository manually.

To push the branch to the remote repository, run:

```bash
git push -u origin initial
```

## Verification

You can verify the branch was created correctly by running:

```bash
# List all branches
git branch -a

# View the commit on the initial branch
git log initial --oneline
```

The `initial` branch should point to commit `e995597`.
